You may include additional packages for typesetting
algorithms, mathematical formula or to define new operators and environments
if and only if there is no conflict with the SeminarV2.cls
file.

It is recommended to avoid the numbering of equations when not
necessary. When dealing with equation arrays, it could be
necessary to label several (in)equalities. You can do it using the
`$\backslash$stackrel' operator (see the SeminarV2.tex source file);
example:

\begin{eqnarray}
c&=&|d|+|e|\nonumber\\
&\stackrel{\text{(a)}}{=}&d+e\nonumber\\
&\stackrel{\text{(b)}}{\geq}&\sqrt{f}\enspace,
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where the equality (a) results from the fact that both
$d$ and $e$ are positive while (b) comes from the definition of
$f$.
