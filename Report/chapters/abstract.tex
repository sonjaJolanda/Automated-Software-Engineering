In the realm of automated software engineering, the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked
significant interest and discussion, particularly in their role
within software configuration. LLMs possess remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, generation,
and pattern recognition. These models can potentially
revolutionize how software configurations are managed and
tackled, offering solutions that range from assisting in
decision-making processes to detecting misconfigurations.
Motivated by the complexities of modern software systems,
which often involve intricate configurations across various
platforms, environments, and technologies, researchers and
practitioners are exploring the role of LLMs in software
configuration. The integration of LLMs in software
configuration raises intriguing questions and challenges, which we want to understand.
